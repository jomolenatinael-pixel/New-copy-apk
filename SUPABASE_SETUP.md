# Areka Supabase setup

## 1. Apply the migration

Apply [`supabase/migrations/20260929_areka_auth_sync.sql`](supabase/migrations/20260929_areka_auth_sync.sql) in the Supabase SQL Editor. It preserves the existing `profiles`, `attempts`, `quizzes`, `questions`, and `choices` data model, extends `profiles`, and adds the app-owned `quiz_attempts`, `flashcard_progress`, and `areka_leaderboard` objects.

The existing `attempts` table is intentionally not reshaped because it lacks a user identity and uses a different schema. New Areka attempts go to `quiz_attempts`.

## 2. Configure Android locally

Create `local.properties` at the repository root. Do not commit it:

```properties
sdk.dir=/path/to/your/Android/sdk
SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY
```

The Android app reads these values into `BuildConfig`. It never needs or accepts a Supabase service-role key.

## 3. Authentication behavior

- Guest mode remains fully usable without a network or account.
- Profile contains validated email/password sign-in, account creation with password confirmation, confirmation-email resend, password-recovery email, and sign-out.
- Supabase Auth sessions start in a visible loading state, are persisted in app-private SharedPreferences, and are refreshed on startup. A transport outage keeps a real cached session for offline study; an invalid refresh token signs out.
- Authenticated REST requests use one centralized client, retry one 401 after refresh, and never expose backend response text as user-facing errors.
- Google OAuth is not enabled in this minimal phase; email/password is enabled in the connected project.
- If email confirmation is enabled, account creation asks the learner to confirm their email before signing in.
- `natijommar@gmail.com` is seeded into the server-owned `user_roles` table. The current-user RPC copies that role to `profiles.is_admin`; Android displays **Admin** only after the RPC response, never from a client email check.

## 4. What is local vs cloud

| Data | Local Room / bundled data | Supabase |
|---|---|---|
| Curriculum, quizzes, flashcards | Primary source; always available offline | Optional question-bank refresh already supported |
| Quiz completion | Written first to Room | Best-effort `quiz_attempts` upload; failed authenticated uploads are queued locally and retried |
| Profile points/streak | Primary local state | Best-effort profile upsert |
| Leaderboard | Empty honest guest state | `areka_leaderboard` for authenticated users |
| Flashcard schedule | Primary local state | Optional `flashcard_progress` backup table; sync hook reserved for the next pass |

Cloud calls run on the IO dispatcher after local writes and never block quiz or flashcard screens. Profile conflict policy is **monotonic server-wins** for `total_points` and `streak_days`: sync uses the higher value. Guest leaderboard rows are intentionally empty rather than seeded with fictional students.

Room tables holding profiles, attempts, mistakes, activities, flashcard schedules, progress, and review logs carry an `ownerUserId` and are queried with the current Auth user ID (or the explicit `guest` owner). Migration `5 -> 6` preserves existing local data under the guest owner and prevents account switching from exposing another account's study state.

## 5. Validation checklist

- [ ] Guest opens Home, Quiz, Flashcards, and Profile with no Supabase configuration.
- [ ] Guest completes a quiz while offline; Room stores the attempt.
- [ ] Sign up with email/password; confirm email if required.
- [ ] Sign in and restart the app; session is restored.
- [ ] Complete a quiz while authenticated and online; verify a row in `quiz_attempts`.
- [ ] Verify `profiles` points/streak update and `areka_leaderboard` appears in Profile.
- [ ] Sign out; Profile returns to guest mode and local study remains available.
- [ ] Sign up/sign in as `natijommar@gmail.com`; confirm the Profile **Admin** badge and `profiles.is_admin = true`.
- [ ] Restart after sign-in; confirm the session and Admin badge persist.
